The Next Frontier: Optimizing Reality with AI (RDM)
The internet stands at a crossroads, and the path we choose now will define our relationship with technology for generations. We can choose a path where business and people survive and thrive together, or one where business continues to subjugate people to short-term profit, to the detriment of both. Over the past three decades, we've built an online world driven by advertising and attention aggregation. The results are hard to ignore: rising loneliness, rampant misinformation, alienation from the physical world, and declines in mental and physical health. But as artificial intelligence revolutionizes our relationship with technology once again, we have an opportunity to course-correct. By harnessing AI to optimize our interactions with reality, we can create a future where technology enhances our connection to the world, rather than replacing it.
We've reached this crossroads through the evolution of the internet. The first generation – Web 1 – was all about making pages machine-readable. Next, in Web 2, the goal was to do the same with users. Now, at the dawn of the third phase, tech leaders face a choice: Do we focus on replacing reality with immersive digital experiences, or do we use our powerful new tools to enrich users' engagement with the physical world around them?
I believe the latter path is the key to a thriving, human-centered future. By applying spatial AI and machine learning to familiar tools like maps, we can create personalized, bespoke experiences that help users discover new facets of the world around them. Imagine a Google Maps that gets to know you like your social media feed does, offering relevant suggestions and insights without the intrusion of sponsored content.
This approach stands in stark contrast to the push for all-encompassing digital platforms. Meta, TikTok, X have reduced reality to a passively watching reality. At a time when society suffers from the consequences of an attention-driven internet, we shouldn't be in the business of replacing reality. Instead, we should harness the power of AI to help people forge deeper connections to the physical world and to each other. The next phase of the internet will be about action and movement, maximizing our relationships to the world around us. 
Of course, no technology is a panacea, and we must remain vigilant about the role of AI and machine learning in our lives. But by focusing on enhancing reality rather than escaping it, we can ensure that human flourishing remains the driving force behind technological innovation. The tech giants of Web 1 and Web 2 rose to dominance by aggregating data and attention; the leaders of tomorrow will thrive by using that data to optimize users' real-world experiences. That's the true promise of the next frontier – and it's a path we must choose now, before it's too late.
